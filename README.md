# Fraud-Analytics-Circular-Trading
Fraud Analytics Using Predictive and Social Network Techniques

# Introduction

In this we try to bring out the companies that have participated in fradulent transactions and to find that out we have focused on the concept of circular trading as explained in the initial report. So the problem finally boils down to finding loops/cycles in the graph of transactions. As the data we used comprises of ___ number of transactions and it wouldn't be possible to find all the loops/cycles with the present avaliable computational resourses. So we have developed the following algorithm, which takes into consideration the loss of data while compression of the graph as well as the optimal compression which fits in the RAM, to detect these potential fraudulent transactions.

## Cycle Detection

Detecting cycles on such a massive transaction data is highly time taking so we first try to group th tractions using two different clustering jaf

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
